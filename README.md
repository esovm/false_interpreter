# INTRO
This is an interpreter for the FALSE language, a stack based lanugage very similiar in nature to FORTH, a more detailed description can be found [here](http://strlen.com/false-language)

# BUILD
Built with the command:
    
    $ghc FALSE

# RUN
The FALSE executable accepts a text file containing a FALSE program and outputs the stack after execution completes

    $ ./FALSE <filename>
